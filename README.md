# Cancer Classification Using Gene Expression Data

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **binary cancer classification system** using real **gene expression data** from NCBI. The goal is to classify samples as **cancerous** or **non-cancerous**. The project explores **machine learning**, **feature selection**, and **hybrid optimization techniques** to improve accuracy.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Real gene expression datasets downloaded from **NCBI**.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and normalized gene expression data for modeling.

3. **Classification Methods**  
   - **SVM:** Initial model achieved ~78.95% accuracy.  
   - **mRMR Feature Selection:** Selected top 200 genes, improving accuracy to 84.21%.  
   - **Hybrid Random Forest + Spider Monkey Optimization:** Selected 87 genes, achieving **94.74% accuracy**.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, and performance metrics calculated in MATLAB.
